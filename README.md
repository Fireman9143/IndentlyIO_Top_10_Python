My answers to the homework for the Indently Udemy 10 python projects

These files are from the Udemy course Learn Python by Coding: 10 projects in Python by Federico Azzurro.  The homework answers are my own.  If you copy and paste and have problems with the code, make sure you have same version of Python, all dependencies installed, and are referencing the correct file paths.
